## Section 05: Neural Networks

Neural networks are important because of their ability to approximate **any** relationship between input variables and target variables. In practice they tend to be difficult to train and difficult to interpret, but excel at pattern recognition tasks in images and sound. A new field of neural networks, known as *deep learning*, has been responsible for some of the most important recent breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
