## Section 10: Practical Model Interpretability

Machine learning algorithms create potentially more accurate models than
linear models, but any increase in accuracy over more traditional,
better-understood, and more easily explainable techniques is not practical for
those who must explain their models to regulators or customers. For many
decades, the models created by machine learning algorithms were taken to be
black-boxes. However, a recent flurry of research has introduced credible
techniques for interpreting complex, machine-learned models. Materials
presented here illustrate applications or adaptations of these techniques for
practicing data scientists.
